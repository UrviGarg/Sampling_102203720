# Credit Card Fraud Detection | Sampling
Assignment on Sampling for UCS654 (Predictive Analysis using Statistics)

## Description
This assignment analyzes a highly imbalanced Credit Card Dataset using various sampling techniques to balance the data. Balanced datasets were created, and machine learning models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective classification technique. Oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) and undersampling were employed.

## Methodology
1. Class Balancing
2. Creating Different Samples
3. Training Machine Learning Models
4. Testing Models
5. Analyzing Results

## Sampling Techniques

1. Simple Random Sampling
2. Stratified Sampling
3. Systematic Sampling
4. Cluster Sampling
5. Multi-Stage Sampling

## Machine Learning Classification Models
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. KNN
5. Naive Bayes

 ## Final Results

## Discussion
From the final Accuracy table, we can conclude that Maximum Accuracy is achieved when we apply Random Forest Algorithm upon taking samples using the Cluster Sampling technique. We get an accuracy of 98.82%.
